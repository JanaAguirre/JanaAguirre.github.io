I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Diagnostic Biochemistry at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I am really interested in the intricate molecular processes that underlie cell behavior,microbial-interactions, bioenergetics, cellular and developmental evolution and bioinformatics.
Furthermore, due to the clinical focus of my major I am deeply interested in fortifying alternative models such as 3D cell cultures, organs-in-chip and organoids to enhace their clinical applicability.
